\section{Goldbatch's Conjecture}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Even number can be written in sum of two primes (Up to $1e12$)
	\item Range of $N^{th}$ prime and $N+1^{th}$ prime will be less than or equal to $300$ (Up to $1e12$)
\end{itemize}

\section{Divisibility}

Number of divisors of $N$ is given by $\prod_{i=1}^{k}(a_i + 1)$ where $N = \prod_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}^{a_{i}}$ and $p_{i}$ are prime factors of $N$.
